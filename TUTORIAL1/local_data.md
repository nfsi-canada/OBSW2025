# Getting Seismic data and metadata

All codes in this workshop are designed to use the [FDSN web services](https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/) to get station information, earthquake catalogues, and waveform data. These are implemented in `ObsPy` as dedicated "clients" that interact with the web services under the hood. For instance:

```
from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client

client = Client('IRIS')
```

In ObsPy, one can either specify a key string that points to a public archive or use the corresponding URL. For instance, the two "clients" below are identical and point to the same archive:

```
client1 = Client('GEONET')
client2 = Client('http://service.geonet.org.nz')
```

To be more specific, I encourage you to use the appropriate `base_url` keyword argument when defining a "client", which makes it explicit:

```
client = Client(base_url='http://service.geonet.org.nz')
```

We can then use these "clients" to get [station information](https://docs.obspy.org/master/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_stations.html#obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_stations), [event catalogues](https://docs.obspy.org/master/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_events.html#obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_events), and [waveform data](https://docs.obspy.org/master/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_waveforms.html#obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_waveforms):

```
inv = client.get_stations(...)
cat = client.get_events(...)
stream = client.get_waveforms(...)
```

### FDSN web services for local data with SeisComP

Oftentimes, the dataset we wish to use is not available publicly and only exists on a local (maybe external) computer drive. Due to the many different ways the data can be formatted and sorted, adapting every codes to be as flexible as possible is a huge task. Instead, it is possible to (re)format the data in a structured way that is coherent with the way FDSN services access the data on remote archives, and run SeisComP locally to enable FDSN web services on the same computer on a local port (e.g., http://localhost:8080), such that we can use the usual ObsPy "client":

```
client = Client(base_url='http://localhost:8080')

client.get_stations(...)
```

SeisComP is already installed on one of the geophysics servers at VUW, such that anyone with properly formatted seismic data will be able to load it into SeisComP and use the FDSN web services for their data set.

### Formatting the seismic data archive

To enable the FDSN web services and load local data sets, SeisComP uses the station XML standard for station metadata and the "SeisComP Data Structure" (SDS) for archiving miniSEED waveform data. 

#### Station XML

The metadata should be formatted as a [stationXML](https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/). The corresponding ObsPy documentation is [here](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/obspy.core.inventory.html). If you don't have a station `.xml` file but you have a dataless SEED file, you can convert it to `.xml` using [this tools](https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/stationxml-converter).

#### Waveform (`.mseed`) data

The SDS folder containing the waveform data has the structure:

```
archive
  + year
    + network code
      + station code
        + channel code
          + one file per day and location, e.g. NET.STA.LOC.CHAN.D.YEAR.DOY
```

For the ELVES data, this is, for example:

```
SDS/
  2023/ (+ 2024/ 2025/)
    3O/
      EL23A/ (+ EL23B/ EL23C/ ...)
        CH1.D/ (+ CH2.D/ CH3.D/)
          3O.EL23A..CH1.D.2023.332
          ...
```

Note, the filename does not include the extension `.mseed`, and the characters `.D` that appear in both the channel code and the filename. Note also the two dots (`..`). If there is a location code, it should appear between those dots (e.g., for a location code `10`, the corresponding filename should be `3O.EL23A.10.CH1.D.2023.332`). There is no location code for the ELVES data, and this field is simply absent from the filenames. Finally, the day-of-year (DOY) field must be zero-padded to be exactly 3 characters.

### Bringing data to the OBS workshop

If you wish to work on your own data set at the workshop, you will need to bring, on a single drive (or share via secure file transfer):

```
drive/
  station_metadata.xml
  SDS/
    ...
```

If you are not sure of your setup, please send us a smaller copy (subset of data) as soon as possible so we can test it before the workshop. 


### Working with ELVES data

The ELVES data will be available via an FDSN web service set up for the workshop through SeisComP. To access the data, you will need to be connected to the local domain (geo.vuw.ac.nz) and use the full URL that points to the SeisComP server, as well as a user name and password. In a Python environment, you can access the ELVES data using the ObsPy tools by specifying

```
client = Client(base_url='http://seiscomp.geo.vuw.ac.nz', user='xxxx', password='xxxx')
client.get_stations(...)
client.get_waveforms(...)
```

For most of the codes we will use during the workshop, you will be able to define the URL as well as the authentication fields using command-line options `--server='http://seiscomp.geo.vuw.ac.nz'` and `--user-auth='xxxx:xxxx'`. We will provide username and password information and examples during the workshop.
